# semantic-nmt

This repository contains the codes and the links to the data for our recent paper "[Semantic Neural Machine Translation using AMR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07282)".
In particular, folders "dual_to_seq", "dual_to_seq_dep", "dual_to_seq_self", "dual_to_seq_srl", "dual_to_seq_linamr" and "seq_to_seq" correspond to our models of "Dual2seq", "Dual2seq-Dep", "Dual2seq (self)", "Dual2seq-SRL", "Dual2seq-LinAMR" and "Seq2seq", respectively.
